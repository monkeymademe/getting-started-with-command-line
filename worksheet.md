## Getting started with command line

Boot up your Raspberry Pi. Congratulations you have had your fist experiance with command line. Each line or sometimes grouping of lines represents a command the Raspberry Pi has been told to do while booting. Once this stops you have logged into the pi, you are left with the following command prompt.

```shell
  pi@raspberrypi $
```

At this point the system is waiting for your command. We would commenly call this the command prompt.

## Section for later 


We are going to start a little journy using command line. But we are going to need a friend to help us along the way.

```shell
  pi@raspberrypi $ touch pete.txt
```

Touch is a command that will simply creat a blank data file.
