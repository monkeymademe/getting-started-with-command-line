# Getting started with Command Line

No matter what operating system you are using you are always giving the computer commands to make it do stuff. Clicking on a file and draging it to another folder is a very basic example.

I want this file to go here

Click and hold- I want > this file 
Drag - To go
Release Click - Here

But there is another way to move our file. We could acctually type a command to tell the computer to move a file from one folder to another. For this we would use command line.

Command Line gives this user the opertunity to tell the computer what we want to do without any user interface. Anything you can do with a point and click you could also use command line and sometimes this can even be quicker when you have had some practice.

This resource will help get you started with command line and get to grips with some basic file and folder control of your system.
